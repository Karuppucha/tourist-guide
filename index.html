        <h2>Visiting the Taj Mahal: Everything you need to know</h2>
        <h5>written by Bex Shapiro&nbsp; | &nbsp;August 9, 2017</h5> 
        <img src="India_Agra_taj_mahal_smile_194.jpg" height="60%" width="70%">&nbsp; <br> <br><br>
        <h3>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj <br>Mahal?</h3><br>
        <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.</p><br>
        <p>At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than <br>building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing <br>its magnificence up close.</p><br>
        <p>After all, this is art. Built in Agra,<a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india">India</a> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s <br>the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj <br>Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from<br> Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.</p><br>
         <p>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), <br>and so much more…</p><br>
         <h3>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
         <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.</p><br>
         <p>Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian<br> men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.</p><br>
         <p>To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.<br> Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456" >8 Golden Triangle tours</a> (now <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india" >solo-only<br> departures!</a>) to <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/india-real-food-adventure-151125" > 15 days trips dedicated to food</a>, to 19-day trips combining the <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/highlights-india-nepal-143752" >highlights of India <br>and Nepal</a>.</p><br>
         <p>If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from <br>Delhi. Check out <strong>urban Adventures</strong> to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while<br> you’re at it, check out their day trips in <a href="https://www.urbanadventures.com/en/delhi" >delhi</a>, <a href="https://www.urbanadventures.com/en/asia" >jaipur</a>,<strong>varansai</strong> and <strong>mumbai</strong>!</p><br>

        <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally <br>prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p><br>
        <h3>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
        <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have <br>minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.</p><br>
        <p>You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p><br>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Passport</li>
            <li>Money</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Medicine</li>
            <li>Camera</li>
            <li>Phone</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
        <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br>need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.</p><br>
        <p>It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear <br> sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.</p><br>
        <p>If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid<br> the worst of the heat.</p><br>

        <img src="India_Agra_taj_mahal_sunset_210.jpg"> <br> &nbsp;
        <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p><br>
        <h3>Other things you need to know</h3><br>
        <p>No food is allowed inside.</p><br>
        <p>Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.</p><br>
        <p>Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with.<br> Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small <br>video cameras) are not allowed.</p><br>
        <p>Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your<br> wits about you and you won’t need to worry!</p><br>
        <h3>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
        <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if<br> possible).</p><br>
    </section>
    <section class="sec-4">
        <img src="taj_mahal_crowds.jpg"> <br>&nbsp;
        <p>If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an <br>amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to<br> take you there and back cheaply.)</p><br>
        <p>And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly <br>(or more!) remain in awe of it.<a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/sana-female-intrepid-leader-india/">Sana Jinah</a> , one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has<br> some tips on how to do this:</p><br>
        <p>She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise <br>on a clear day.</p><br>
        <h3>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
        <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit <br>on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.</p><br>

    <section class="sec-5">
        <img src="sitting image.jpg"><br> &nbsp;
        <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth<br> seeking out.</p><br>
        <p>Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/pravin-intrepid-manager-gender-equality-india/">Pravin <br>Tamang</a>. (His photography is amazing – <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/cities-india-street-photography/">check it out</a>!)</p><br>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li> 
            <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main <br>platform</li>
            <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
            <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
            <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal.<br> Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the <br>day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</p><br>

        <h3>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
        <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then <br>explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p><br>
        <h4>What to do in Agra</h4><br>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is<br> also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century <br>Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.</p><br>
        <p>Despite being located on the <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456">Golden Triangle</a> tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in<br> many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you <br>likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.</p><br>
        <p>One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by (sometimes) <br>taking travelers to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/sheroes-hangout-cafe-is-run-entirely-by-acid-attack-survivors_n_13830342"> Sheroes Hangout</a>. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe<br> run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their<br> stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</p><br>

        <h3>Where to go outside of Agra</h3><br>
        <p>There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these,<br> Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.</p><br>
        <p>Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back <br>and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit <br>it on <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/delhi-kathmandu-143454">  this 15-day trip</a> from <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/nepal/delhi-to-kathmandu">Delhi to Kathmandu</a> (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p><br>
    </section>
    <section class="sec-7">
        <img src="india_orchha_temple.jpg"><br>&nbsp;
        <p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/top-colourful-cities/">‘Pink City’,</a> the capital of Rajasthan is full of<br> chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting <br>bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.</p><br>
        <p>Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home <br>to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy<br> nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable.

        <h3>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h3><br>
        <p>As you may have <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/taj-mahal-mud-restoration/">read</a> or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough <br>clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.</p><br>
        <p>Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white <br>surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work –<br> applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried<br> out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects<br> carried out on the historic site.</p><br>
